To the next group that works on this app: I am sorry, so terribly sorry.

Here are some things to work on that we couldn't get done:
     Store a profile picture in the database with each user
     Connect our login with google login
     Make friends accept friend requests, then update both friends lists
     	  The current system followers, not friends.
     Figure out how to use cookies client-side
     setup a self-signed certificate to use https for our web traffic so we aren't sending
     	   everything unencrypted over the air


Passwords are hashed client side with sha256(password + username)
but the hashes are sent unencrypted to the server in a login attempt

Being "Logged in" just means sending a cookie with your _id.
but we don't do anything to prevent cookie stealing.
The cookie looks encrypted, and I think the cookie secret has something to do with it,
but i'm not sure, and it probably isn't secure
If someone can edit their cookie, they could pretend to be anyone.
Also our client-side code dosen't support cookies

If you are wondering why my functions hit the database 3 times, it is because
I don't know a better way to do it.

Good luck!
